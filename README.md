You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`.

The model in the demo is rendered using Google's open source package [Model-Viewer](https://modelviewer.dev/)
We can embed 3d objects and AR features directly to the web. [Model-Viewer](https://modelviewer.dev/) also provides CDN links that we can use in Scripts, So you don't have to worry about whether the library is compatible with your choice of framework or not.
